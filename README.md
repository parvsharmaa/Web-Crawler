This project is based on Micro Service Architure which includes a web crawler and SDK designed to retrieve and access data from the internet.

## Web Crawler

The Web Crawler is a microservice responsible for searching the internet and collecting products data from various e-commerce sources. It performs web scraping operations to extract relevant information and returns the data for further processing. The Web Crawler is designed to be scalable and efficient, capable of handling multiple concurrent requests.

###  Web Crawler implements *Factory Design Pattern* to ensure :

1. Dynamic Object Creation: The factory pattern allows for the dynamic creation of different types of web crawlers based on specific requirements or configurations.
2. Encapsulation: By encapsulating the object creation logic within the factory class, we can abstract away the details of the crawler's instantiation process from the client code.
3. Flexibility: The factory pattern provides flexibility by enabling the addition of new crawler types or variations without modifying existing client code.
4. Configuration Management: It facilitates the management of different configurations or settings for each type of web crawler, making it easier to maintain and update.
5. Dependency Injection: The factory pattern promotes dependency injection, allowing the client code to interact with the web crawler interface rather than directly with concrete implementations, thus improving modularity and testability.

### Features

- Microservice solely focused on extracting the data
- Searches the internet for data
- Performs web scraping to extract information
- Returns the data to affected entities
- Scalable architecture for handling high volumes of requests

## SDK (Software Development Kit)

The SDK provides a convenient interface for developers to access the data collected by the Web Crawler. It exposes methods for retrieving search results, analyzing trends, and accessing other relevant information stored in the database. The SDK is designed to be user-friendly and easy to integrate into existing applications.

### SDK implements *Singleton Design Pattern* to ensure :

1. Global Access: The singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the SDK class throughout the application's lifecycle, providing global access to its methods and properties.
2. Resource Management: Since the SDK may involve resource-intensive operations or maintain global state (such as authentication tokens), using a singleton ensures efficient resource utilization and avoids unnecessary duplication.
3. Consistency: By having a single instance of the SDK, we can maintain consistency in its state and behavior across different parts of the application, preventing inconsistencies that may arise from multiple instances.
4. Initialization Control: The singleton pattern allows us to control the initialization process of the SDK, ensuring that it is properly configured and ready for use before being accessed by other components.
5. Concurrency Control: In multi-threaded environments, the singleton pattern provides a mechanism for thread-safe access to shared resources, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity.

### Features

- Provides methods for accessing search results within the Database.
- Analyzes trends and patterns in the collected data.
- Easy-to-use interface for developers.
- Faster retults for search queries via Indexing.
- Rate Limiter to prevent system overload, ensure fair resource allocation and mitigate DoS attacks.
- Seamless integration with other applications.
- Provides User Authentication and Authorization for security.
- Uses MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL) for easy and secure data storage.

## Installation and Setup

### To use the Web Crawler and SDK via Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Docker and Docker Desktop if you haven't already.
3. Build the Docker images for the Web Crawler and SDK using the provided Dockerfiles within sub-directories.
5. cd into the root directory of the project i.e. `LYNC-Backend-Developer-Task`
6. Run `docker-compose up` to start the services and the two servers.
7. Access both web crawler (on port 8080) and sdk (on port 3000) using api routes.
8. At last, Run `docker-compose-down` to stop and remove the container services.

### To run Docker Images using Docker Hub, you can use the following commands

1. For Web Crawler -
   Run `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 parvsharmaa/web-crawler:latest`

2. For SDK -
   Run `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 parvsharmaa/sdk-node:latest`

### Note : 
After successfully running the services, you can access the servers on Port numbers 3000 (for sdk) and 8080 (for web-crawler) respectively.

## Exposed Routes

### Web Crawler

- `/scrape` (POST) : Scrapes the data from website for a particular search phase and returns the products list . Expects 3 body parameters :

    1. website (string) : The website name to scrape the products list. (Required) 
    2. searchPhrase (string) : The search keyword for the product. (Required) 
    3. scrapeToPage (integer) : The page number till which to scrape the products list. (Optional) 
    
    Ideal Response: `{ message: "Scraping successful", data: [ ...productsList ]}`
